Dataset.csv file contains 3 columns (Test 1 ,Test 2, Result), and 118 rows. 
Reg_LogisticRegression.ipynb is the notebook that implements the logistic regression.
LogReg_Func.py contains functions of simple logistic functions.
utils.py contains functions that are necessary to implement some tasks, such as plots.


This notebook is inspired by Practice Lab of the course "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification", offered by Deeplearning.ai and Stanford University on Coursera.
